# Train Reservation System

## Overview

The Train Reservation System is a powerful software application designed to manage train bookings efficiently. The system incorporates user authentication, shortest path computation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and a dynamic ticket management solution that handles a database of over 500 trains.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:**  
  Secure platform for users to register and log in.

- **Shortest Path Calculation:**  
  Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between stations.

- **Ticket Management:**  
  Book, add, cancel, and print train reservations.

- **Database Handling:**  
  Manages train data and user reservations using Linked Lists, Graphs, Queues, and File Handling.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Used

- **Graphs:**  
  Representation of the train network.

- **Linked Lists:**  
  Dynamic storage of train data and reservations.

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**  
  Calculation of the shortest path between stations.

- **Queues:**  
  Management of ticket booking requests.

- **File Handling:**  
  Persistent storage and retrieval of train and user data.

## Usage

1. **User Registration/Login:**  
   Create a new account or log in with your existing credentials.

2. **Book a Ticket:**  
   Choose your source and destination; the system will calculate the shortest route using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

3. **Manage Reservations:**  
   Add, book, or cancel reservations and print tickets.
